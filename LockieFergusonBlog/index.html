            <p>
                Lockie Ferguson is a renowned New Zealand fast bowler, known for his express pace and aggressive style. Born on 13 June 1991 in Auckland, New Zealand, he began his cricket journey at a young age and quickly made a mark with his sharp bowling skills. Ferguson made his debut for New Zealand in international cricket in 2016 and has since been a key player in their limited-overs squad. His ability to bowl at high speeds combined with accuracy makes him a formidable opponent. He has represented Auckland in domestic cricket and has played in various T20 leagues around the world, including the IPL and Big Bash League. Despite facing injuries early in his career, Ferguson's determination and work ethic have allowed him to bounce back stronger each time. He continues to be a valuable asset to New Zealandâ€™s cricket team. Off the field, Ferguson is known for his humble nature and dedication to fitness and training. His contributions both on and off the field have inspired many young cricketers.
